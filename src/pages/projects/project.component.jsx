      <strong>Description :</strong> 
      <br />This project is taken up because India is an agriculture oriented country and the rate at which water resources are depleting is a dangerous threat hence there is a need of smart and efficient way of irrigation. In this project we have implemented sensors which detect the humidity in the soil (agricultural field) and supply water to the field which has water requirement. 
      Our aim of the work is to simplify the method of irrigation. The soil moisture sensor is pressed in the soil. It takes continuous readings of the moisture percentage of the soil. The readings are sent to the 8051 micro-controller continuously. A permissible value is set in the program for functioning of the sensor. 
      If the sensor value falls below this permissible value, the buzzer starts ringing. The output of the buzzer is connected to Arduino. As the buzzer rings, Arduino sends a notification to the mobile application about the low water content in the soil. The user can switch on the water sprayer to water the crops, through the mobile. If he switches it ON, Arduino will check the available water level in the tank with the help of ultrasonic sensor. If there is sufficient water in the tank, the water sprayer will automatically turn ON, otherwise it will display a message that the water in tank is not sufficient to water the crops, through the mobile application.

      <br />The Home Automation System is mainly constructed to make it easy for the user nowadays in their household, in this era of automation. 
      The weather monitoring system is used to monitor different weather parameters. This project is a combination of both the ideas to automate the surroundings around the user to make it pleasant and comfortable conditions even if the weather is different. This system is used to cope up with the environmental conditions and make the home comfortable automatically or by just switching it through android app installed in a phone. 
      The system can be also operated by blind or disabled people through the voice recognition technique. A security system is also included to open the home door by entering password and the mail is sent to the admin automatically of the image of the intruder if wrong password is entered. The system is cost â€“ effective and flexible with many types of device to be controlled.

      <strong>Description :</strong> 
      <br />The main problem is the ECG signal can be disturbed by noise or interferences, which are of various forms such as muscle artifacts, baseline wander, power line interferences, channel noise and so on. These interferences in the signal introduce errors during disease detection. ECG signal processing has turned into an important medium for research and clinical practices. 
      The power line interferences can be successfully removed from the ECG signal by various means to obtain a denoised signal. These are based on different calculations on the filters and algorithms. This project is based on denoising electrocardiogram signal using methods such as Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS) Algorithm, Notch Filter, Wavelet transform thresholding and Moving Average filter using the smoothing algorithm. The Power Spectral Density (PSD) and spectrogram graphs are plotted. Execution parameters like SNR, %PRD, MSE and spectral densities are computed and compared for different samples. 
      The real-time recorded information are acquired from the benchmark MIT-BIH arrhythmia database.

      <br />A chatbot is a PC program intended to mimic an insightful discussion with a human client by means of sound-related or printed strategies. The vast majority of the visit bots are intended for taking part in casual banter and their identities are made by the software engineer. 
      The objective of this project is to design and implement a chat-bot based on natural language processing which can establish real-time engagement with customers. Under social media, this chat-bot can establish relation for media marketing. The project is identified with how a program can naturally separate organized information from plain content keeping in mind the end goal to "import" the existence occasions and in this way the identity of the fake substance. At that point we continue to talk about the genuine execution of the conversational specialist beginning from this information base for every distinctive individual. 
      Toward the end, a few outcomes are featured and remarked utilizing a particular recorded figure.
